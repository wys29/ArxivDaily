- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20604v1
- **Authors**: ['Alexandros Christoforos', 'Chadbourne Davis']
- **Abstrat**: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

- **Abstrat**: Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.





## MERGE-RNA: a physics-based model to predict RNA secondary structure ensembles with chemical probing

- **Abstrat**: The function of RNA molecules is deeply related to their secondary structure, which determines which nucleobases are accessible for pairing. Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods.

## Repurposing Video Diffusion Transformers for Robust Point Tracking
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20606v1

- **Abstrat**: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.
