- **Authors**: ['Radha Lahoti', 'Ryan Chaiyakul', 'M. Khalid Jawed']
- **Abstrat**: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.

## HiF-VLA: Hindsight, Insight and Foresight through Motion Representation for Vision-Language-Action Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09928v1

- **Abstrat**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.





## Token Expand-Merge: Training-Free Token Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models

- **Authors**: ['Yifan Ye', 'Jiaqi Ma', 'Jun Cen', 'Zhihe Lu']
- **Abstrat**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets have emerged as powerful foundations for robotic perception and control. However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

## LISN: Language-Instructed Social Navigation with VLM-based Controller Modulating

- **Abstrat**: Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

## YOPO-Nav: Visual Navigation using 3DGS Graphs from One-Pass Videos

- **Abstrat**: Visual navigation has emerged as a practical alternative to traditional robotic navigation pipelines that rely on detailed mapping and path planning. However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for visual navigation and scene representation research.
