## Inchworm-Inspired Soft Robot with Groove-Guided Locomotion

- **Abstrat**: Soft robots require directional control to navigate complex terrains. However, achieving such control often requires multiple actuators, which increases mechanical complexity, complicates control systems, and raises energy consumption. Here, we introduce an inchworm-inspired soft robot whose locomotion direction is controlled passively by patterned substrates. The robot employs a single rolled dielectric elastomer actuator, while groove patterns on a 3D-printed substrate guide its alignment and trajectory. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that varying groove angles enables precise control of locomotion direction without the need for complex actuation strategies. This groove-guided approach reduces energy consumption, simplifies robot design, and expands the applicability of bio-inspired soft robots in fields such as search and rescue, pipe inspection, and planetary exploration.

- **Abstrat**: We present new Chandra/ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy of two luminous type 2 quasars, FIRST J120041.4+314745 (z=0.116) and 2MASX J13003807+5454367 (z=0.088), and compare their X-ray emission with Hubble Space Telescope [O III]$λ$5007 morphologies and kinematics. Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$α$ line at E$_{\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.

## Efficient and Compliant Control Framework for Versatile Human-Humanoid Collaborative Transportation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07819v1
- **Authors**: ['Shubham S. Kumbhar', 'Abhijeet M. Kulkarni', 'Panagiotis Artemiadis']
- **Abstrat**: We present a control framework that enables humanoid robots to perform collaborative transportation tasks with a human partner. The framework supports both translational and rotational motions, which are fundamental to co-transport scenarios. It comprises three components: a high-level planner, a low-level controller, and a stiffness modulation mechanism. At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans. These are executed by a QP-based whole-body controller that accounts for the coupled humanoid-object dynamics. Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass. We validate the effectiveness of the framework through real-world experiments conducted on the Digit humanoid platform. To quantify collaboration quality, we propose an efficiency metric that captures both task performance and inter-agent coordination. We show that this metric highlights the role of compliance in collaborative tasks and offers insights into desirable trajectory characteristics across both high- and low-level control layers. Finally, we showcase experimental results on collaborative behaviors, including translation, turning, and combined motions such as semi circular trajectories, representative of naturally occurring co-transportation tasks.





## MAPLE: Encoding Dexterous Robotic Manipulation Priors Learned From Egocentric Videos

- **Abstrat**: Large-scale egocentric video datasets capture diverse human activities across a wide range of scenarios, offering rich and detailed insights into how humans interact with objects, especially those that require fine-grained dexterous control. Such complex, dexterous skills with precise controls are crucial for many robotic manipulation tasks, yet are often insufficiently addressed by traditional data-driven approaches to robotic manipulation. To address this gap, we leverage manipulation priors learned from large-scale egocentric video datasets to improve policy learning for dexterous robotic manipulation tasks. We present MAPLE, a novel method for dexterous robotic manipulation that learns features to predict object contact points and detailed hand poses at the moment of contact from egocentric images. We then use the learned features to train policies for downstream manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPLE across 4 existing simulation benchmarks, as well as a newly designed set of 4 challenging simulation tasks requiring fine-grained object control and complex dexterous skills. The benefits of MAPLE are further highlighted in real-world experiments using a 17 DoF dexterous robotic hand, whereas the simultaneous evaluation across both simulation and real-world experiments has remained underexplored in prior work. We additionally showcase the efficacy of our model on an egocentric contact point prediction task, validating its usefulness beyond dexterous manipulation policy learning.

## Incremental Generalized Hybrid A*

- **Abstrat**: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning. We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning. IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA* use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version of HA* (HA*M, an internal baseline). In simulated off- road experiments in a high-fidelity simulator, IGHA* outper- forms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex dynamics.
